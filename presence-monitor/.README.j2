## About

This add-on actually is a usage convenient shell for launching [the Andrew J Freyer's monitor script](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor) on the same machine where the Home Assistant itself works.
This script useful for MQTT-based home automation, especially when the script runs on multiple devices, distributed throughout a property.

## Features

* Convenient way to start indoor presence detection.
* You can use Home Assistant configuration secrets in add-on configuration.
* All necessary software is installed by itself. And regularly updated to the latest versions.
* The script is almost configured — just enter a couple of remaining settings.
* Complete freedom in reconfiguring the script to your needs.
* You can combine add-on and common versions of this presence monitor script in any combinations.
