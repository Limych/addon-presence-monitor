## About

This add-on actually is a usage convenient shell for launching [the Andrew J Freyer's monitor script](https://github.com/andrewjfreyer/monitor) on the same machine where the Home Assistant itself works.
This script useful for MQTT-based home automation, especially when the script runs on multiple devices, distributed throughout a property.

You can combine add-on and common versions of this presence monitor script in any combinations.
